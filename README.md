# RussianCasualtiesInTheWar2022
Test application for MacPaw internship.

My suggestions for expanding and improving the application.
The first screen may contain a choice between categories:
Losses, a map of current hostilities, the history of the Russian invasion since 2014 and should finally be links to a gallery of pictures and videos confirming the losses and the direct guilt of the Russian Federation.
 It will be very useful to have a section where you can clearly show NATO assistance to Ukraine and give examples of weapons and examples of their use.
  And finally, the economic, demographic and international perspectives of Russia using examples: for example, as graphs of the economic state of Russia over the past 8 years. It would be nice to provide feedback with relatives of the Russian military and publish their stories.
